# Light Speed File Explorer
Also known by its working title, TabsPls.
A modern approach to a file system explorer, can we have some tabs please?

## Why use this?
Because you're done with Windows' built in file explorer that still does not support tabs to this date. Not using Windows? Then you probably use a terminal emulator with nice and smooth auto completion. But this does not integrate well with other graphical user interface tooling. You can't drag and drop for example, you also can't select files and folders to copy and paste.

Light Speed File Explorer combines fast navigation with the convenience of a graphical user interface, from which you can drag files into emails, collaboration tools and more. Did I mention it also supports tabs? Because is does.

## Multiple flavours
The front-end comes in a GTK flavour and a Universal Windows Platform flavour, this is to maximize integration on GNU/Linux and Windows respectively.
